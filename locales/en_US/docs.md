# [Limitations](#limitations)

---

### File Signature

Files encrypted with File Encryption & Decryption are identifiable by looking at the file signature that is used by the app to verify the content of a file, Such signatures are also known as magic numbers or Magic Bytes. These Bytes are authenticated and cannot be changed.

### Safari and Mobile Browsers

Safari and Mobile browsers are limited to a single file with maximum size of 1GB due to some issues related to service-workers. In addition, this limitation also applies when the app fails to register the service-worker (e.g FireFox Private Browsing).

<br>

# [Best Practices](#best-practices)

---

### Choosing Passwords

The majority of individuals struggle to create and remember passwords, resulting in weak passwords and password reuse. Password-based encryption is substantially less safe as a result of these improper practices. That's why it is recommended to use the built in password generator and use a password manager like [Bitwarden], where you are able to store the safe password.


If you want to choose a password that you are able to memorize then you should type a passphrase made of 8 words or more.

<br>

### Using public key encryption instead of a password

If you are encrypting a file that you are going to share it with someone else then you probably should encrypt it with the recipient public key and your private key.

<br>

### Sharing Encrypted Files

If you plan on sending someone an encrypted file, it is recommended to use your private key and their public key to encrypt the file.

The file can be shared in any safe file sharing app.

<br>

### Sharing the public key

Public keys are allowed to be shared, they can be sent as `.public` file or as text.

> Never share your private key to anyone! Only public keys should be exchanged.

<br>

### Storing the Public & Private keys

Make sure to store your encryption keys in a safe place and make a backup to an external storage.

Storing your private key in cloud storage is not recommended!

<br>

### Sharing Decryption Passwords

Sharing decryption password can be done using a safe end-to-end encrypted messaging app. It's recommended to use a _Disappearing Messages_ feature, and to delete the password after the recipient has decrypted the file.

> Never choose the same password for different files.

<br>

# [FAQ](#faq)

---

### Does the app log or store any of my data?

No, File Encryption & Decryption never stores any of your data. It only runs locally in your browser.

<hr style="height: 1px">

### Is File Encryption & Decryption free?

Yes, File Encryption & Decryption is free and always will be.

<hr style="height: 1px">

### Which file types are supported? Is there a file size limit?

File Encryption & Decryption accepts all file types. There's no file size limit, meaning files of any size can be encrypted.

Safari browser and mobile/smartphones browsers are limited to 1GB.

<hr style="height: 1px">

### I forgot my password, can I still decrypt my files?

No, we don't know your password. Always make sure to store your passwords in a password manager.

<hr style="height: 1px">

### Why am I seeing a notice that says "You have limited experience (single file, 1GB)"?

It means that your browser doesn't support the server-worker fetch api. Hence, you are limited to small size files. see [Limitations](#limitations) for more info.

<hr style="height: 1px" id="why-need-private-key">

### Is it safe to share my public key?

Yes. Public keys are allowed to be shared, they can be sent as `.public` file or as text.

But make sure to never share your private key with anyone!

<hr style="height: 1px">

### Why the app asks for my private key in the public key encryption mode?

File Encryption & Decryption uses authenticated encryption. The sender must provide their private key, a new shared key will be computed from both keys to encrypt the file. Recipient has to provide their private key when decrypting also. this way can verify that the encrypted file was not tampered with, and was sent from the real sender.

<hr style="height: 1px">

### I have lost my private key, is it possible to recover it?

Nope. lost private keys cannot be recovered.

Also, if you feel that your private key has been compromised (e.g accidentally shared / computer hacked) then you must decrypt all files that were encrypted with that key, generate a new keypair and re-encrypt the files.

<hr style="height: 1px">

### Does the app measure password strength?

We use [zxcvbn](https://github.com/dropbox/zxcvbn) JS implementation to check the entropy of the password input, this entropy will be converted to score that will be displayed on screen.

<hr style="height: 1px">

### Does the app connect to the internet?

Once you visit the site and the page loads, it runs only offline.

<hr style="height: 1px">

### Why should I use File Encryption & Decryption?

1. The app uses fast modern secure cryptographic algorithms.
2. It's super fast and easy to use.
3. It runs in the browser, no need to setup or install anything.
4. It's free opensource software and can be easily self hosted.

<hr style="height: 1px">

### When should I not use File Encryption & Decryption?

1. If you want to encrypt a disk (e.g [VeraCrypt]).
2. If you want to frequently access encrypted files (e.g [Cryptomator]).
3. If you want to encrypt and sign files in the same tool. (e.g [Kryptor]).
4. If you prefer a command line tool (e.g [Kryptor]).
5. If you want something that adheres to industry standards, use [GPG].

# [Technical Details](#technical-details)

### Password hashing and Key derivation

Password hashing functions derive a secret key of any size from a password and a salt.

<br>

<div class="codeBox">

```javascript
let salt = sodium.randombytes_buf(sodium.crypto_pwhash_SALTBYTES);
let key = sodium.crypto_pwhash(
  sodium.crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_KEYBYTES,
  password,
  salt,
  sodium.crypto_pwhash_OPSLIMIT_INTERACTIVE,
  sodium.crypto_pwhash_MEMLIMIT_INTERACTIVE,
  sodium.crypto_pwhash_ALG_ARGON2ID13
);
```

</div>

The `crypto_pwhash()` function derives an 256 bits long key from a password and a salt salt whose fixed length is 128 bits, which should be unpredictable.

`randombytes_buf()` is the easiest way to fill the 128 bits of the salt.

<br>

`OPSLIMIT` represents a maximum amount of computations to perform.

`MEMLIMIT` is the maximum amount of RAM that the function will use, in bytes.

<br>

`crypto_pwhash_OPSLIMIT_INTERACTIVE` and `crypto_pwhash_MEMLIMIT_INTERACTIVE` provide base line for these two parameters. This currently requires 64 MiB of dedicated RAM. which is suitable for in-browser operations.
<br>
`crypto_pwhash_ALG_ARGON2ID13` using the Argon2id algorithm version 1.3.

<br>

### File Encryption (stream)

In order to use the app to encrypt a file, the user has to provide a valid file and a password. this password gets hashed and a secure key is derived from it with Argon2id to encrypt the file.

<br>

<div class="codeBox">

```javascript
let res = sodium.crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_init_push(key);
header = res.header;
state = res.state;

let tag = last
  ? sodium.crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_TAG_FINAL
  : sodium.crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_TAG_MESSAGE;

let encryptedChunk = sodium.crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_push(
  state,
  new Uint8Array(chunk),
  null,
  tag
);

stream.enqueue(signature, salt, header, encryptedChunk);
```

</div>

The `crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_init_push` function creates an encrypted stream where it initializes a `state` using the key and an internal, automatically generated initialization vector. It then stores the stream header into `header` that has a size of 192 bits.

This is the first function to call in order to create an encrypted stream. The key will not be required any more for subsequent operations.

<br>

An encrypted stream starts with a short header, whose size is 192 bits. That header must be sent/stored before the sequence of encrypted messages, as it is required to decrypt the stream. The header content doesn't have to be secret because decryption with a different header would fail.

A tag is attached to each message accoring to the value of `last`, which indicates if that is the last chunk of the file or not. That tag can be any of:

1. `crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_TAG_MESSAGE`: This doesn't add any information about the nature of the message.
2. `crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_TAG_FINAL`: This indicates that the message marks the end of the stream, and erases the secret key used to encrypt the previous sequence.

The `crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_push()` function encrypts the file `chunk` using the `state` and the `tag`, without any additional information (`null`).
<br>

the XChaCha20 stream cipher Poly1305 MAC authentication are used for encryption.

`stream.enqueue()` function adds the File Encryption & Decryption signature(magic bytes), salt and header followed by the encrypted chunks.

### File Decryption (stream)

<div class="codeBox">

```javascript
let state = sodium.crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_init_pull(header, key);

let result = sodium.crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_pull(
  state,
  new Uint8Array(chunk)
);

if (result) {
  let decryptedChunk = result.message;
  stream.enqueue(decryptedChunk);

  if (!last) {
    // continue decryption
  }
}
```

</div>

The `crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_init_pull()` function initializes a state given a secret `key` and a `header`. The key is derived from the password provided during the decryption, and the header sliced from the file. The key will not be required any more for subsequent operations.

<br>

The `crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_pull()` function verifies that the `chunk` contains a valid ciphertext and authentication tag for the given `state`.

This function will stay in a loop, until a message with the `crypto_secretstream_xchacha20poly1305_TAG_FINAL` tag is found.

If the decryption key is incorrect the function returns an error.

If the ciphertext or the authentication tag appear to be invalid it returns an error.

<br>

### Random password generation

<div class="codeBox">

```javascript
let password = sodium.to_base64(
  sodium.randombytes_buf(16),
  sodium.base64_variants.URLSAFE_NO_PADDING
);
return password;
```

</div>

The `randombytes_buf()` function fills 128 bits starting at buf with an unpredictable sequence of bytes.

The `to_base64()` function encodes buf as a Base64 string without padding.

<br>

### Keys generation and exchange

<div class="codeBox">

```javascript
const keyPair = sodium.crypto_kx_keypair();
let keys = {
  publicKey: sodium.to_base64(keyPair.publicKey),
  privateKey: sodium.to_base64(keyPair.privateKey),
};
return keys;
```
</div>

The `crypto_kx_keypair()` function randomly generates a secret key and a corresponding public key. The public key is put into publicKey and the secret key into privateKey. both of 256 bits.

<br>

<div class="codeBox">

```javascript
let key = sodium.crypto_kx_client_session_keys(
  sodium.crypto_scalarmult_base(privateKey),
  privateKey,
  publicKey
);
```
</div>

Using the key exchange API, two parties can securely compute a set of shared keys using their peer's public key and their own secret key.

The `crypto_kx_client_session_keys()` function computes a pair of 256 bits long shared keys using the recipient's public key, the sender's private key.

The `crypto_scalarmult_base()` function used to compute the sender's public key from their private key.

<br>

### XChaCha20-Poly1305

XChaCha20 is a variant of ChaCha20 with an extended nonce, allowing random nonces to be safe.

XChaCha20 doesn't require any lookup tables and avoids the possibility of timing attacks.

Internally, XChaCha20 works like a block cipher used in counter mode. It uses the HChaCha20 hash function to derive a subkey and a subnonce from the original key and extended nonce, and a dedicated 64-bit block counter to avoid incrementing the nonce after each block.
